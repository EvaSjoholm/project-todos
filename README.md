## The problem
My biggest issue is naming the different functions and during the programming process missing details in spelling or if I change as I code. This affected the synced components and created a redo of a lot of code and costed time. Now that I have gotten a better understanding of styled components, I would have also created a Globalsyle file instead of adding it into exisiting components to clean up the code. 

I got help both from 1:1 meeting with Technigo, other and former student's as well as using Stack a great deal and google. I chose to go by my style of liking which is simple, earth friendly vibe so I enjoyed having that freedom.
